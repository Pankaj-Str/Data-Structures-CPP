## Linked Lists

### Linked List Basics

This section provides a basic introduction to linked lists, a fundamental data structure. You'll find simple linked list implementations and operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

### Doubly Linked List

Doubly linked lists are an extension of the basic linked list, featuring nodes with both next and previous pointers. This section explores the implementation and usage of doubly linked lists.

### Circular Linked List

Circular linked lists are similar to singly linked lists but have their last node pointing back to the first node. This section covers the creation and manipulation of circular linked lists.

## Stack & Queue

### Stack

Stacks are linear data structures that follow the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle. This section explains the implementation of stacks, including common operations like push and pop.

### Expression Parsing

Expression parsing is a common application of stacks. Learn how to use stacks to evaluate mathematical expressions and handle parentheses in this section.

### Queue

Queues are linear data structures that follow the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle. This section explores the implementation of queues, including enqueue and dequeue operations.

## Graph Data Structure

### Graph Data Structure

Graphs are versatile data structures used to model various relationships. This section introduces the graph data structure and its basic operations.

### Depth First Traversal

Depth-First Traversal is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Learn how to implement this algorithm in this section.

### Breadth First Traversal

Breadth-First Traversal is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the neighbor vertices at the current level before moving to the next level. This section covers the implementation of BFS.

### Spanning Tree

Spanning trees are essential in graph theory. This section explains what spanning trees are and how to find them in a graph.

## Tree Data Structure

### Tree Data Structure

Trees are hierarchical data structures with various applications. This section introduces the concept of trees and basic tree operations.

### Tree Traversal

Tree traversal is the process of visiting all the nodes in a tree in a specific order. This section covers common tree traversal algorithms like in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals.

### Binary Search Tree

Binary Search Trees (BSTs) are a type of binary tree with a specific property. Learn how to implement BSTs and perform operations like insertion and deletion.

### AVL Tree

AVL trees are self-balancing binary search trees. This section explores the AVL tree data structure and how it maintains its balance during insertions and deletions.

### Red-Black Trees

Red-Black Trees are another type of self-balancing binary search tree. This section covers the implementation of Red-Black Trees and their balancing rules.

### B Trees

B-Trees are balanced search trees used in databases and file systems. Learn about the structure and use of B-Trees in this section.

### B+ Trees

B+ Trees are an extension of B-Trees optimized for disk-based storage. This section explores B+ Trees and their advantages in storage systems.

### Splay Trees

Splay Trees are a self-adjusting binary search tree. Discover the Splay Tree data structure and how it reorganizes itself for efficient access to frequently accessed elements.

### Tries

Tries are tree-like data structures used for efficient retrieval of strings. This section introduces Trie data structures and their applications, including prefix searching.

### Heap

Heaps are specialized tree-based data structures used for prioritization and sorting. Learn about max heaps, min heaps, and heap operations in this section.

## Recursion

### Recursion Basics

Recursion is a fundamental programming concept. This section covers the basics of recursion, including recursive functions and base cases.

### Tower of Hanoi

The Tower of Hanoi is a classic problem that can be solved using recursion. This section explains the problem and demonstrates how to solve it recursively.

### Fibonacci Series

The Fibonacci series is often used to illustrate recursion. Learn how to generate Fibonacci numbers using recursive algorithms in this section.
